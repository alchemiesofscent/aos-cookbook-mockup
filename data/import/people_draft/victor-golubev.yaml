  Victor Golubev is an organic chemist at the Chemistry of Natural Products Group at the Institute of Chemistry of the Czech Academy of Sciences. He works primarily in area of synthesis and application of phosphine ligands for transition metal catalysis.

  At Alchemies of Scent, Victor is responsible for analysis and replication of ancient procedures of perfume preparation. Victor will analyze oils that could be used as substrates, reproduce the methodologies using modern equipment, develop chemical explanation of ongoing processes during oil preparations and analyse materials using analytical instruments like GC/LC-MS.
