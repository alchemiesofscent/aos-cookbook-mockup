  Jakub Smrček is an organic chemist at the Chemistry of Natural Products Group at the Institute of Chemistry of the Czech Academy of Sciences. He works primarily in total synthesis of natural compounds for the study of their structure and potential biological activity.

  At Alchemies of Scent, Jakub is responsible for replicating ancient procedures for the preparation of perfumes and the analysis of the products from the perspective of modern chemistry.
