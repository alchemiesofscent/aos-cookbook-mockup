  Matteo is Professor in History of Science and Principal Investigator of the ERC Project AlchemEast: Alchemy in the Making: From ancient Babylonia via Graeco-Roman Egypt into the Byzantine, Syriac and Arabic traditions (1500 BCE -1000 AD).

  At Alchemies of Scent, Matteo discussed ancient techniques designed to change the colour of metals, thus reasoning on the development of Graeco-Egyptian chrysopoeia (the making of gold) and argyropoeia (the making of silver). More details about the lecture are here.
