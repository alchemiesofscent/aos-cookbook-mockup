  Maarten Janssen is a computational linguist, with a special interest in corpora, lexica, and formal semantics. He was responsible for the system behind the official vocabulary of Portuguese (VOC), and is currently mostly known as the main author of the TEITOK corpus system. His PhD is from Utrecht University, and he has worked in various research institutes around Europe: OTS (Utrecht), ERSS (Toulouse), ILTEC (Lisbon), IULA (Barcelona), CLUL (Lisbon), CELGA (Coimbra), and is currently working at UFAL (Prague).

  Maarten Janssen is responsible for overseeing the creation of a corpus out of the source material used in Alchemies of Scent, and for developing a system that can be used to model recipes and ingredients directly over the source material.
