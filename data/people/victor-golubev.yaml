shortBlurb: Organic chemist coordinating replication and analytical workflows for ancient perfume oil preparation methods.
bio: |-
  Victor Golubev is an organic chemist in the Chemistry of Natural Products Group at the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Czech Academy of Sciences. He works primarily on synthesis and application of phosphine ligands for transition-metal catalysis.

  At Alchemies of Scent, Victor is responsible for analysis and replication of ancient perfume preparation procedures. He analyzes candidate oils used as substrates, reproduces ancient methodologies with modern equipment, develops chemical explanations of ongoing processes during oil preparation, and evaluates materials using GC/LC-MS.
